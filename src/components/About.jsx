             of Mount Lavinia and currently 19 years old, I find myself
            deeply entrenched in the dynamic world of software
            engineering. My journey began with a fascination for both
            front-end and back-end development, which led me to explore
            a diverse array of technologies. Delving into the intricacies

            Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML,</strong> sculpting captivating user interfaces that 
            engage and inspire. Venturing into the backend realm, I've engineered 
            robust systems using  <strong>Spring Boot</strong> while also exploring the versatility 
            of <strong>Node.js</strong>. Fuelled by an unwavering passion for crafting intuitive user 
            experiences and architecting scalable solutions, I'm committed to pushing 
            the boundaries of innovation in the digital sphere. Join me as we embark on 
            an exhilarating journey where technology and creativity converge, shaping
